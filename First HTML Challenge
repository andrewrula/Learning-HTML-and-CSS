            Andrew is an English major, who is currently making money to purchase things by exchanging his time for a paltry amount of money, to be paid to him on an hourly basis by a company that he sorta likes but not in a long term kind of way. His facebook, since that's really all that matters in the world anymore, can be found <a href="http://www.facebook.com/andrew.rula"> here! </a>
            </p>

            He is currently dating a lovely person named Tessa. She's pretty great, but she'll never know that he wrote that because this website is going to vanish in a pretty short amount of time.

		<h3> Random Nonsense</h3>
		<!--Heebs! Look! My code is even sorta commented a little bit! -->
            <p>This final paragraph is going to include some random blathering, in the form of ordered and unordered lists. It will also contain a healthy amount of other things like a random quote from Anton Scalia's dissent this week.</p>

			<p>And now for Justice Scalia! 
			<blockquote cite="http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-gay-marriage-scalia-dissent-20150626-story.html"> "Take, for example, this court, which consists of only nine men and women, all of them successful lawyers who studied at Harvard or Yale Law School. Four of the nine are natives of New York City. Eight of them grew up in east- and west-coast States. Only one hails from the vast expanse in-between. Not a single south-westerner or even, to tell the truth, a genuine Westerner (California [where Kennedy hails from] does not count). Not a single evangelical Christian (a group that comprises about one quarter of Americans), or even a Protestant of any denomination. The strikingly unrepresentative character of the body voting on today's social upheaval would be irrelevant if they were functioning as judges .... But of course the justices in today's majority are not voting on that basis."</blockquote>
